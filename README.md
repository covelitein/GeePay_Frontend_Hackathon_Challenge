# GeePay_Frontend_Hackathon_Challenge
Welcome to the Analytics Dashboard, a project crafted by Covenant Abraham during GeePay Frontend Hackathon Challenge. The Analytics Dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for visualizing and analyzing data trends, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to provide actionable insights. Throughout the hackathon, I dedicated my efforts to conceptualizing and developing this solution, harnessing the power of React, TypeScript, Mantine UI, Recharts, Tailwind CSS, to bring it to life.


## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Mantine UI**: A React component library designed for rapid development of accessible and customizable web applications.
- **Recharts**: A composable charting library built on React components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
